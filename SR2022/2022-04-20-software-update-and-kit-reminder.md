Hello all!

We have just released an update to the Kit's software which **must** be installed in order for your robot to see the arenas wall markers. The update can be found on our [docs page](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/kit/brain_board/updates), the version released was 2022.2.0.

Let us know in Discord, or by email, if you have any issues.

Also just a quick reminder to **bring all SR kit** with you to the competition, so it can be returned at the end of the event. A list of our standard kit can be found on [our docs](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/kit/) but if you have additional kit from previous years please do bring that as well.

We look forward to seeing you all at the competition!
