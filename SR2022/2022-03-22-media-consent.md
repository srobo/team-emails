subject: Media Consent Form

As with previous years, we require you to sign a media consent form. These media consent forms allow us to use videos and photographs taken at the event for future marketing purposes. However, the process has changed slightly.

[Download our Media Consent form]()

Please put "Student Robotics 2022" as the event name.

Please bring this form with you to the competition. We will have spares at reception, but this will allow you, your competitors and guests to proceed through faster. Depending on whether you give consent or not, we will issue you with a wristband or lanyard, so we ensure you are not in any of our media.

If you have any questions on this process, please let us know.
