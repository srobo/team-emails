Hello!

As you may know, we're using Discord this year for much of our teams communication.

We notice that none of your team has signed up to Discord yet. It's not required, but it's the fastest way to communicate with us and get support or mentoring. It also helps us check in and see how you're getting on. If you missed the details, or they aren't working, please let us know.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
