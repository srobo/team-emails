subject: Are you in Discord?

Hello!

As you may know, we're using Discord this year for much of our teams communication.

We notice that whilst there are some members of your team in Discord, there's no team supervisor present. If you've not already joined, we highly recommend doing so. If you have, let us know your username and we can give you the relevant permissions and roles. It's the fastest way both to get support from us, and interact with other people in the competition.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
