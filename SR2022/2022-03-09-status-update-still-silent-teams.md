Hi {team-supervisor-name},

We haven't heard from your team in a while and wanted to check how you're doing?

If you're struggling with your robot, or if you're just keeping your strategy
secret (we promise we won't tell anyone) we'd love to know how we can best
support your team.

Alternatively if your team are dropping out, please let us know and we'll be in
touch with details of how to return the kit.

Could you please give a quick status update on how you're doing?

Thanks,
-- the Competition Team
