subject: Supporting your team

Hello!

How are you and your team getting on? We'd love to hear how your robot is progressing, how the competitors are finding the challenge, and if there is anything we can do help your team progress.

Please let us know by either replying to this email, or letting us know in Discord.

## Discord

As you may know, we're using Discord this year for much of our teams communication.

{% if the team is empty %}
We notice that none of your team has signed up to Discord yet. It's not required, but it's the fastest way to communicate with us and get support or mentoring. If you missed the details, or they aren't working, please let us know.
{% elif no supervisor %}
We notice that whilst there are some members of your team in Discord, there's no team supervisor present. If you've not already joined, we highly recommend doing so. If you have, let us know your username and we can give you the relevant permissions and roles.
{% endif %}

## The role of the supervisor

In Student Robotics, your role is the team's "supervisor" (also referred to as "team leader"). The role of the supervisor is about both supporting the competitors as they build their robot, and ensuring they are organised and have all the information they need from us to operate in the competition.

Our documentation is there to aid everyone, competitors and supervisors alike. Whilst having some form of engineering experience is useful in supporting the competitors, it's not required. A mixture of our documentation, and help from our talented volunteers should provide you all need to get the most out of the competition.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
