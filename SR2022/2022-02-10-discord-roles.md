subject: How is your team getting on?
---

Hello!

As you may know, we're using Discord this year for much of our teams communication.

{% if the team is empty %}
We notice that none of your team has signed up to Discord yet. It's not required, but it's the fastest way to communicate with us and get support or mentoring. If you missed the details, or they aren't working, please let us know.
{% elif no supervisor %}
We notice that whilst there are some members of your team in Discord, there's no team supervisor present. If you've not already joined, we highly recommend doing so. If you have, let us know your username and we can give you the relevant permissions and roles.
{% endif %}

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
