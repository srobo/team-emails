Hello!

We regret to inform you that Student Robotics 2019 is full. This year we are running on reduced resources, and are unable to host as many teams as we have in previous years.

We invite you to keep an eye on our website, to follow this competition years progress, and we hope to run a larger competition for Student Robotics 2020.
