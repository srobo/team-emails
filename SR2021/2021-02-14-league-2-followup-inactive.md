subject: Would you like a mentor?
---

Hi,

It was great to see your robot at the second league session. We hope you found
it as exciting as we did and are looking forward to the new challenges which
module Ⅲ brings. The full rulebook and simulator updates are available on our
website, so do check them out if you haven't already!

We also wanted to check on how you're doing and whether there's any more help
you need?

In addition to Discord, we'd also like to offer you some more hands-on support
in the form of a regular mentor. This would be a volunteer who is able to be
around whenever you regularly meet and would get to know your team and your
robot. Whatever platform you use (whether it's Discord or something else),
they'd be able to join your meetings to help you out. (For safeguarding reasons
we need your team leader to also be in any video calls; your team leader will
have details about this).

If you're interested in having a regular mentor please just reply to this
email, letting us know when you meet and what platform you use.

Otherwise, there's usually lots of volunteers around in Discord to help out
if you need anything. Whether it's help programming your robot, organising your
team or you just need a fresh pair of eyes on something. Our volunteers have a
wealth of experience from both competing in Student Robotics and helping lots of
teams, so there's a good chance they can help :)

P.S: We've found that teams who meet regularly tend to do better, so if your
team doesn't have a regular meeting time you might find it helps to set one up.
