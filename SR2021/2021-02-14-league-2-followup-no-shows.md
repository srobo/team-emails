Hi,

We noticed your team didn't make it to the recent league sessions. We wanted to
reach out to see if there was any more support we could provide you, or questions
we could answer?

There's usually lots of volunteers around in Discord to help out if you need
anything, whether it's help programming your robot, organising your team or you
just need a fresh pair of eyes on something. Our volunteers have a wealth of
experience from both competing in Student Robotics and helping lots of teams, so
there's a good chance they can help :)

We'd also like to offer you some more hands-on support in the form of a regular
mentor. This would be a volunteer who is able to be around whenever you
regularly meet and would get to know your team and your robot. Whatever platform
you use (whether it's Discord or something else), they'd be able to join your
meetings to help you out. (For safeguarding reasons we need you or another adult
responsible for the team to also be in any video calls).

If you're interested in having a regular mentor please just reply to this
email, letting us know when you meet and what platform you use.

{% if inactive %}
Alternatively, if your team will no longer be competing in Student Robotics
please let us know so we can remove you from this year's mailing lists.
{% endif %}

P.S: if you don't have a regular meeting time, that's fine too. We have found
that teams who meet regularly tend to do better though!
