Hi,

You've received this email because you're taking part in the Student
Robotics competition. To attend the competition this year, you'll need a
ticket, and to return a media consent form (which covers media recorded
at the competition).

To do this, please visit the following link:

  https://www.studentrobotics.org/mediaconsent

And enter your SR username / password. (Ask your teacher if you don't
have one yet). It'll then give you a PDF, please print it off and follow
the instructions about signing it, then return it to your teacher.
Later, you'll receive an email about how to get your competition ticket,
and about bringing it to the competition.

This is necessary for attending this years competition -- if you do not
return the media consent form, or turn up to the competition with a
ticket, you may be refused entry!

Thanks,
Jeremy
