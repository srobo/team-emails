Subject: Student Robotics: Competition date and tech days

Hi {first_name},

We're now able to confirm the date and location of the competition -- it
will be held on the 25th and 26th of April 2014, at the Newbury
Racecourse Grandstand. We'll get a preliminary schedule to you shortly,
but as with previous competitions we expect both days to run from 0900
until 1730.

While our volunteers will be operating the competition, they won't be
able to provide supervision for the attendees. As a result, all
attending competitors need to have some kind of adult supervision
provided by you: who does this, and what form it takes is up to
you, but the responsibility can't fall on our volunteers, sorry.

As in previous years, we're unable to provide transportation,
accommodation, or food for the competition. You will need to arrange
these for your team yourselves. Please note thought that if you're
unable to find accommodation then Reading is sufficiently close to
Newbury to be an alternative.

Entrance to the competition for competitors is ticketed: we require
signed media consent forms to be returned (in advance) for each
attending competitor. After we receive those, a printable ticket will
become available, that competitors will need to bring with them.
Everyone else, including teachers, parents, and other interested parties
are welcome to attend, although they'll need to either bring a media
consent form with them or sign one at the door. Non-competitor attendees
under the age of 18 will need a parent/guardian in attendance too.

To return a media consent form, competitors and team leaders should access
the following URL:

  https://www.studentrobotics.org/mediaconsent

Which will serve them a media consent form with their details written
into it. They should print out a copy, have their parent/guardian fill out
the missing parts as appropriate, and return it to you the team leader. Once
you've collected all media consent forms, please return them to Student
Robotics, either via post at:

  Jeremy Morse
  Dept of Computer Science
  Merchant Venturers Building
  Woodland Road
  BRISTOL
  BS8 1UB

Or by scanning and emailing them to jmorse@studentrobotics.org. Scans must
be of print-quality please, photographing the form is insufficient. Once we've
processed a form, the competitor will receive an email linking them to the
ticket download page.

We've also confirmed the dates of a couple of upcoming tech days. There
will be tech days in both Bristol and Southampton on the 14th March:

Please email info@studentrobotics.org if you intend to attend one of these tech days.

A full list of dates, and links to the event pages where location and
further details are available, are on the key dates page:
