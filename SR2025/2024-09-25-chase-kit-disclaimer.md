Hi,

Thanks for signing up for SR2025! We're getting ready to ship you your kit but before we can do that we need you to sign our Kit Disclaimer form. I've attached the form again to this email, please could you **get it back to us by Friday 27th September**. If we don't receive your form we won't be able to guarantee your kit will arrive prior to Kickstart.

If you have any issues or concerns please do reach out.

Many Thanks,

James
Student Robotics Competition Team
