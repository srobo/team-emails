Hi,

Happy New Year! We hope you had a restful break and energised to continue building your robots!

We have a few updates and reminders for you:

* The next [Tech Days][tech-days] are in Cambridge, [on 25th January][cambridge-tech-day-january], and then back in Horsham [in February][horsham-tech-day-february] -- please [sign up][tech-day-signup] if you're interested
* The second [Challenge submission deadline][challenge-deadline] is later this month
* The [Virtual League][virtual-league] is coming up in February

## Second Challenge Deadline

The [Challenges][challenges] offer stepping stones towards building your robot as well as allowing teams to collect valuable league points ahead of the competition. There are three Challenges which can be approached in any order.

The second challenge deadline is coming up on Saturday **15th January 2025** at **18:00** UK time. Your team can submit any of the three challenges by this time to earn 6 league points for each they haven't already completed.

There is one further submission deadline later in the year, though nothing stops your team getting all their submissions in sooner than that.

## Virtual League

Coming up in February, the [Virtual League][virtual-league] will be the first league matches of the competition. Run in the simulator, teams will pit their code against each other to score points.

To [submit your code][code-submitter-docs] for the Virtual League:

* Visit the [Code Submitter][code-submitter]
* Log in using the same credentials as you used to get access to your team's area in Discord
* Create a zip archive containing your code
* Upload the archive to the Code Submitter

## Tech Days

[Tech Days][tech-days] are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their robot with lots of help available -- from a mix of long-experienced volunteers and more recent ex-competitors. They're also an opportunity to see how other teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your robots.

There are three Tech Days left this year:

* [**25th January 2025** - at Raspberry Pi Foundation in Cambridge][cambridge-tech-day-january]
* [**15th February 2025** - at Red River Software in Horsham][horsham-tech-day-february]
* [**8th March 2025** - at Raspberry Pi Foundation in Cambridge][cambridge-tech-day-march]

If you're interested in attending any of these events, please **[sign up to Tech Days][tech-day-signup]**.
Volunteers may also be around virtually on these days for support, should you not be able to attend any events in person.

For the January tech day, the deadline is Friday 17th January 2025 for you to [let us know][tech-day-signup] that you'd like to attend. We will be allocating and confirming places from early December.
