Hi,

With the competition cycle in full swing we hope your team has found its feet.

We have a few updates and reminders for you:

* We have released an update to the simulator, fixing a few bugs
* The first [Challenge submission deadline][challenge-deadline] is in a week and a half
* We're running some virtual friendlies in a couple of weeks
* The next [Tech Day][tech-days] is in Cambridge, [in January][cambridge-tech-day-january] -- please [sign up][tech-day-signup] if you're interested

## Simulator Update

Using competitor feedback we have released a new version of the simulator with some fixes. This can be downloaded from [our GitHub](https://github.com/srobo/sbot_simulator/releases/download/2025.1.1/sbot-simulator-2025.1.1.zip) or using the link in [the simulator docs](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/simulator/setting_up_simulator).

We've fixed a few issues around the run script not being able to find Webots and ensured that you have all the libraries available to you that are on your robots. These libraries are listed [on our docs](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/kit/brain_board/python_libraries).

Please note that the simulator requires a Python version between 3.9 and 3.12. This is due to an issue with installing the libraries on Python 3.13. We recommend using Python 3.11, the same as is installed on your robot. Downloads for all operating systems are available from [the Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/).

## First Challenge Deadline

The [Challenges][challenges] offer stepping stones towards building your robot as well as allowing teams to collect valuable league points ahead of the competition. There are three Challenges which can be approached in any order.

The first challenge deadline is coming up on Saturday **7th December 2024** at **18:00** UK time. Your team can submit any of the three challenges by this time to earn 6 league points.

There are two further submission deadlines in the new year, with each different submission worth a further 6 points.

## Virtual Friendlies

Coming up in February, the Virtual League will be the first league matches of the competition. Run in the simulator, teams will pit their code against each other to score points.

Ahead of the Virtual League, we're running some friendly matches in December. These aren't worth any points, so offer a stress free environment to test out any code you might have. The deadline for submitting your code for the Virtual Friendlies is Thursday **12th December 2024** at **18:00** UK time.

To submit your code for the Virtual Friendlies (and later the Virtual League):

* Visit the [Code Submitter][code-submitter]
* Log in using the same credentials as you used to get access to your team's area in Discord (for your the username is `{TLA}` and password is `{DiscordPassword}`)
* Create a zip archive containing your code
* Upload the archive to the Code Submitter

## Tech Days

[Tech Days][tech-days] are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their robot with lots of help available -- from a mix of long-experienced volunteers and more recent ex-competitors. They're also an opportunity to see how other teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your robots.

There are three Tech Days left this year:

* [**25th January 2025** - at Raspberry Pi Foundation in Cambridge][cambridge-tech-day-january]
* [**15th February 2025** - at Red River Software in Horsham][horsham-tech-day-february]
* [**8th March 2025** - at Raspberry Pi Foundation in Cambridge][cambridge-tech-day-march]

If you're interested in attending any of these events, please **[sign up to Tech Days][tech-day-signup]**.
Volunteers may also be around virtually on these days for support, should you not be able to attend any events in person.

For the January tech day, the deadline is Friday 17th January 2025 for you to [let us know][tech-day-signup] that you'd like to attend. We will be allocating and confirming places from early December.
