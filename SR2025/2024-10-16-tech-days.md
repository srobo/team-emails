Hi,

[Tech Days][tech-days] are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working
on their robot with lots of help available. They're also an opportunity to see
how other teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well
as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your
robots.

We're planning on running 4 tech days:

- [**23rd November 2024** - at Red River Software in Horsham](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2025/horsham-tech-day-november)
- [**25th January 2025** - at Raspberry Pi Foundation in Cambridge](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2025/cambridge-tech-day-january)
- [**15th February 2025** - at Red River Software in Horsham](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2025/horsham-tech-day-february)
- [**8th March 2025** - at Raspberry Pi Foundation in Cambridge](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2025/cambridge-tech-day-march)

If you're interested in attending any of these events, please complete [this form][tech-day-signup]. Volunteers may also be around virtually on these days for support, should you not be able to attend any events in person.

For the November tech day, spaces are limited to four teams, so be sure to [let us know][tech-day-signup]
by Friday 15th November 2024 if you'd like to attend. We will be allocating and
confirming places for it as we receive applications, so sign up soon to avoid
disappointment.
