Hi TODO_NAME,

When you signed up for SR2025, you provided a phone number which appears to be a landline number. Where possible we very much prefer to have a phone number (typically a mobile number) for the primary contact of a team as this ensures we can reach them when they are away from the parent institution, for example at events or during the school holidays. We will only use the number provided when we need to reach you urgently.

Are you able to provide us with a contact number that you will have with you outside of the school?

Thanks,
Peter
