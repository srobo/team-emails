Hi,

We had a lot more interest in Student Robotics 2025 than we had places
available. This has meant that unfortunately we're unable to offer you a place
this year.

We realise this is disappointing (we're disappointed too!), however we are
limited by the number of kits we have and by the size of the venue. We are
always looking for ways to support more teams and hope to be able to do so in
future.

{{ if team_is_on_waiting_list }}
We've put you on our waiting list so if we have any early drop outs we will be
sure to let you know. You may be able to take their place, but we cannot promise
anything. Let us know if you don't want to be on the waiting list.
{{ end_if }}

We hope you follow the competition on social media, and subscribe to our
[mailing list](https://studentrobotics.org/compete/) to be the first to know
when places open for Student Robotics 2026.

Thanks again for your interest, and we hope to see you next year.

Thanks,
 -- Student Robotics
