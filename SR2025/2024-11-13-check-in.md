Hi {PrimaryGivenName},

Just wanted to check in on how your team is doing?

It would be great to hear roughly what stage your team is at, including if
there's anything you'd like a hand with.

{% if not in discord %}
We noticed that your team isn't present in Discord -- is this something that
you'd be able to encourage them to join? Teams which are in Discord are able to
get help much more easily from our volunteers and tend to do better overall.
{% endif %}

Thanks,
Peter
