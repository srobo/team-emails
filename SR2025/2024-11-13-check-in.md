Hi {PrimaryGivenName},

Just wanted to check in on how your team is doing?

It would be great to hear what your team is currently working on and if there's
anything you'd like a hand with.

{% if not in discord %}
We noticed that your team isn't present in Discord -- is this something that
you'd be able to encourage them to join? Teams which are in Discord are able to
get help much more easily from our volunteers and tend to do better overall.
{% endif %}

As a reminder, if you'd like to come to the [Horsham Tech Day][horsham-tech-day]
please [let us know][tech-day-signup] this week.

Thanks,\
Peter
