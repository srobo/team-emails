Hi {PrimaryGivenName},

Happy New Year!

Just wanted to check in on how your team is doing?

It would be great to hear what your team is currently working on and if there's
anything you'd like a hand with.

A couple of quick reminders for the next few weeks:

* if you'd like to come to the [Cambridge Tech Day][cambridge-tech-day] on
  Saturday 25th please [let us know][tech-day-signup] this week
* the second [Challenge Deadline][challenge-deadline] is also coming soon -- get
  your submissions in by 6pm Saturday 25th to earn another 6 league points

Thanks,\
Peter
