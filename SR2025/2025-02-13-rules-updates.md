Hi,

We've released an update to the [rules][rulebook], which clarifies what is included as part of our Safety Inspections.

As a reminder, your robot will be inspected at the start of the competition event to ensure it conforms to our [Safety Regulations](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/rules/safety_regulations). Your robot must pass before it is allowed into a physical arena.

Among the regulations already present in the rules, this update additionally requires that any wiring must be tidy and securely mounted and that any electronics must be mounted such that they are not easily damaged.

We recommend familiarising yourself with the safety regulations, and ensuring your robot conforms, to avoid needing to make drastic changes at the competition.

The exact wording for these new regulations can be found in the [rulebook][rulebook]. If you or your team ave any questions, please reach out either through Discord or by replying to this email.

Thanks,

-- SR Competition Team
