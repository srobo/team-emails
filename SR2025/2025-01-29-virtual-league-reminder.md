Hi,

With a little over half of the competition year now complete we hope your robots are progressing well.

## Virtual League

The [Virtual League][virtual-league] is the first stage of the SR2025 league.

This is the first test of your team's coding skills, pushing their virtual robot
to the limit, competing against other teams in a virtual arena and offering
valuable experience in real matches. Points earned in the Virtual League are
part of the main league, so they could make all the difference at the
physical league.

Your team must submit their code **two days before**, by 6pm GMT on Thursday 6th
February via the code submitter: <https://studentrobotics.org/code-submitter/>.
Your team can login using your three letter acronym (`{TLA}`) as the
username and the password is the same as the password your team used to enter
Discord: `{DiscordPassword}`. Both the username and password are case sensitive.

Code should be [submitted][code-submitter-docs] as a *zip archive* containing at
least a `robot.py` file in the root of the archive. Your team can make as many
submissions as they like, with the last one before the submission deadline being
used. This allows them to continue working on their code even after having made
an initial submission.

There will be four appearances per team in the Virtual League, with each Virtual
League match being worth half a Main League match. Only teams who submit code
before the deadline will have appearances in the Virtual League. To ensure your
team does not miss out on this opportunity for points, be sure that they [submit
some code][code-submitter-docs] before then.

The matches will be broadcast live on **Saturday 8th March 2025 at 1pm GMT** via
a [livestream][virtual-league-livestream] on our YouTube channel.

## Tech Days

As a reminder, we also have a Tech Day coming up shortly after the Virtual League.
This is in Horsham on [**Saturday 15th February**][horsham-tech-day-february].

[Tech Days][tech-days] are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their robot with lots of help available -- from a mix of long-experienced volunteers and more recent ex-competitors. They're also an opportunity to see how other teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your robots.

There are two Tech Days left this year:

* [**15th February 2025** - at Red River Software in Horsham][horsham-tech-day-february]
* [**8th March 2025** - at Raspberry Pi Foundation in Cambridge][cambridge-tech-day-march]

If you're interested in attending any of these events, please **[sign up to Tech Days][tech-day-signup]**.
Volunteers may also be around virtually on these days for support, should you not be able to attend any events in person.

For the February tech day, the deadline is Friday 7th February 2025 for you to [let us know][tech-day-signup] that you'd like to attend.
