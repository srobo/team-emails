Hi {PrimaryGivenName},

Just wanted to check in on how your team is doing?

It would be great to hear what your team is currently working on and if there's
anything you'd like a hand with.

As a reminder, if you'd like to come to the [Cambridge Tech Day][cambridge-tech-day]
on Saturday 25th January please [let us know][tech-day-signup] by Friday 17th January.

Happy holidays,\
Peter
