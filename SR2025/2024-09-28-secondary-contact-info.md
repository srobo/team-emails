Hi {SecondaryGivenName},

As you're hopefully aware from {PrimaryName},
[Student Robotics][student-robotics] is an exciting competition for
16-19 year-olds which a team from {SchoolName} is taking part in.

{PrimaryGivenName} gave us your details as a secondary contact at
{SchoolName} in the unlikely case that we are unable to contact them.
Please speak to them in the first instance if you have any questions.

As [team supervisor][team-supervisor], {PrimaryGivenName} is
responsible for your competitors as well as the [kit][kit] which we loan to each
team. Our communication with your team will also all be sent to them.

If you would like to be copied into our emails with your team then feel free to
let us know.

Thanks,\
-- Student Robotics
