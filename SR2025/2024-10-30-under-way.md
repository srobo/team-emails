Hi,

We hope you enjoyed Kickstart earlier in this month, whether you attended in
person or [watched the livestream][livestream].

## Getting Started

If your team haven't already done so, the place we'd recommend they start is
with the [pre-Kickstart activities][pre-kickstart-activities] and the
[microgames]. Many of the tasks are self-evident when they're completed, however
for some you may need to refer to the [super-secret answer sheet][microgames-answers].

Together these introduce your team to our [documentation][docs] and
[Discord][discord], which are key places to get information and support for
building their robot, as well as giving your team the basic knowledge to get
started with the kits and their robot.

If after completing the microgames your team are looking for the next step, a
good place to go would be the [Challenges][challenges]. These are the first
opportunity to earn points in the competition and start teams building
components which will be useful for their robot, while still being fairly
self-contained.

Alongside the Challenges your team may find it useful to read through our
"[Robots 101][robots-101]" series, which provide general guidance on starting
working on a robot.

Finally, for the first Tech Day of the year (in [Horsham in late November][horsham-tech-day])
we will be focussing on supporting your team towards having a moving base for
their robot. We'll have lots of volunteers on hand with lots of related
experience, including a mix of ex-competitors willing to share what they learned
while competing.
If this interests your team, please **[sign up for the Tech Day][tech-day-signup]**
as spaces are limited.

## Mentoring

Where possible we aim to pair up each team with one of our volunteers as a
mentor. A mentor can guide your team towards good solutions for their robot,
provide assistance where they might need it, as well as helping them to
understand the kit, the rules, and the competition as a whole.

If you would like a mentor to visit your team meetings on a regular basis,
either by video chat or in person, please **[sign up for mentoring][mentoring-signup]**.
We will need a responsible adult to be present from yourÂ side (yourself, another
teacher, a parent, etc.) during these mentoring sessions.

For those who have already signed up we'll be in contact as soon as we have a
volunteer who's able to mentor your team, if we haven't already done so.

If your team doesn't yet have a regular meeting time, please enter "unconfirmed"
in the times, you will be able to edit your response later.

## Tech Days

[Tech Days][tech-days] are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working
on their robot with lots of help available -- from a mix of long-experienced
volunteers and more recent ex-competitors. They're also an opportunity to see
how other teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well
as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your
robots.

We're running 4 tech days:

- [**23rd November 2024** - at Red River Software in Horsham][horsham-tech-day], which will focus on getting your robot moving
- [**25th January 2025** - at Raspberry Pi Foundation in Cambridge](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2025/cambridge-tech-day-january)
- [**15th February 2025** - at Red River Software in Horsham](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2025/horsham-tech-day-february)
- [**8th March 2025** - at Raspberry Pi Foundation in Cambridge](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2025/cambridge-tech-day-march)

If you're interested in attending any of these events, please **[sign up to Tech Days][tech-day-signup]**.
Volunteers may also be around virtually on these days for support, should you not be able to attend any events in person.

For the November tech day, spaces are limited to four teams, so be sure to [let us know][tech-day-signup]
by Friday 15th November 2024 if you'd like to attend. We will be allocating and
confirming places for it as we receive applications, so sign up soon to avoid
disappointment.
