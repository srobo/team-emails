Hello,

We just wanted to check in on how your team is getting on with their robot? Now that you're just over half way through the competition cycle.

It'd be great to hear what you team is currently working on, any difficulties they've faced, and whether there's anything they or you would like a hand with.

If you are no longer able to compete, please let us know.

Thanks,
-- Student Robotics
