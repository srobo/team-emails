Hi,

We hope you enjoyed Kickstart earlier in this month, whether you attended in
person or [watched the livestream][livestream]. As announced at Kickstart, the game this year is "[The Neutral Zone][rules]", where you're tasked with collecting and cataloging chemical samples.

## Getting Started

If your team haven't already done so, the place we'd recommend they start is
with the [simulator activities][simulator-activities] and the
[microgames][microgames]. Please note, we have released a new version of the simulator bundles to fix a bug that prevented saving images from the camera.
If you had previously installed the simulator, we recommend downloading the new simulator bundle from our docs.

Together these introduce your team to our [documentation][docs] and
[Discord][discord], which are key places to get information and support for
building their robot, as well as giving your team the basic knowledge to get
started with the kits and their robot.

If after completing the microgames your team are looking for the next step, a
good place to go would be the [Challenges][challenges]. These are the first
opportunity to earn points in the competition and start teams building
components which will be useful for their robot, while still being fairly
self-contained.

Alongside the Challenges your team may find it useful to read through our
"[Robots 101][robots-101]" series, which provide general guidance on starting
working on a robot.

## Challenge Days

As mentioned at kickstart, we'll be running a few Challenge Days (formally known as "[Tech Days][tech-days]") throughout the year.

Challenge Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working
on their robot with lots of help available -- from a mix of long-experienced
volunteers and more recent ex-competitors. They're also an opportunity to see
how other teams are doing, get more direct help with your robots, and get much faster feedback on [Challenges][rules].

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well
as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your
robots.

We're planning on running 2 Challenge Days:

- **24th January 2026** in Horsham
- **21st February 2026** in Cambridge

These dates are provisional, and we're working on confirming them as soon as possible. Volunteers may also be around virtually on these days for support, should you not be able to attend any events in person.

## Kits

As was mentioned at Kickstart, we have had some delays with shipping kits. We can't apologise enough about this. Not only are we doing everything we can to get kits sent out as soon as possible, but we're also taking steps to ensure these issues cannot repeat in future years. We are currently aiming to have kits arrive by the 21st November, however we'll let you know as soon as kits are dispatched.

{% if no_disclaimer_form %}
Before we can send your kit to you we need you to sign and return the Kit Disclaimer form we previously sent you.
{% endif %}

{% if unpaid_invoice %}
Our records show you are yet to pay the invoice we previously sent you. Please let us know once the invoice has been paid, so we can dispatch your kit.
{% endif %}

{% if not no_disclaimer_form and not unpaid_invoice %}
Thanks for returning your disclaimer form and paying the invoice - We have everything we need from you. As soon as your kit is dispatched, we'll let you know.
{% else %}
The sooner we have the above information, the sooner we can dispatch your kit.
{% endif %}
