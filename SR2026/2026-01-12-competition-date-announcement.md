Hi,

We are happy to confirm that [Student Robotics 2026](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2026/competition/) will be taking place on **Saturday 11th April to Sunday 12th April** at the University of Southampton Students' Union! We apologise for the delay. The doors will open at **9am** on both days, with the Opening Ceremony at **10am** on Saturday, with each day finishing at **5pm**. Both Saturday and Sunday will have league matches with no teams being eliminated before the Knockout on Sunday afternoon. As this is a full weekend event, you'll need to organise travel, accommodation and food for anyone attending.

We'll be announcing further details, including a full schedule for the weekend, as we get closer to the event. If you have any questions in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out by email or in Discord.

But don't forget, the second [challenge](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/resources/2026/challenges.html) deadline is this **Saturday 24th January** at **6pm**. If you're yet to complete any challenges, come along to one of our Challenge Days to receive hands-on mentoring from our volunteers, including live challenge judging and quick feedback.

We're planning on running 2 Challenge Days:

- [**24th January 2026** - at Raspberry Pi Foundation in Cambridge](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2026/cambridge-challenge-day-january)
- [**21st February 2026** - at Red River Software in Horsham](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2026/horsham-challenge-day-february)
