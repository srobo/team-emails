Hi,

We're pleased to [announce][announcement] that registration for Student Robotics
2026 is now open. The [programme][programme-structure] will run from our Kickstart event in November to the in-person competition over two days around Easter 2026.

If you would like to compete, please complete the [signup form][signup-form]
with the details of your team. Entries must be made by a responsible adult on
behalf of a team -- we call this role a [team supervisor][team-supervisor]. All
future emails about SR2026 will be sent to the details you provide via the form.

This year we're hosting [Kickstart][kickstart] at the University of Southampton,
on Saturday 8th November. We will also be live-streaming the event for those
unable to attend in person. We expect to confirm places towards the end
of September. Places are limited, so sign up soon to avoid disappointment.

As usual we will loan competing teams a [kit][kit] of parts to help build their
robots. Teams can collect their kit from the Kickstart event, so they can get started straight away. If you're unable to attend in person, we aim to ship your kit to you prior to the event. We'll confirm further details about this once you've registered for the year.

We have also created some [pre-Kickstart activities][pre-kickstart-activities]
which enable anyone to start learning about robotics and our simulator.

  [Sign up to SR2026][signup-form]

Further details about what to expect from the [Kickstart event][kickstart], as well as details from [last year's competition][sr2025-blog-post] can be found on our website.

We look forward to seeing your teams,

Regards,

-- SR Competition Committee
