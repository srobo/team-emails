Hello,

## Competition Details

As mentioned in a previous email, the [Student Robotics 2026 competition](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2026/competition/) will be taking place on **Saturday 11th April to Sunday 12th April** at the University of Southampton Students' Union.

Our volunteers are working hard to get the event ready for you. To best support your team, we need to know roughly how large your team is, and whether there are any special considerations we need to take for anyone who is coming.

We understand you might not know the exact number of team members who will attend, so vague guesses are absolutely fine for now! You'll be able to edit your response until our plans are finalised. If you still want to make changes after that, please send us an email and we'll see what we can do.

[Fill out your team details](https://forms.gle/9vNgYY6TY2LpYCSz8)

As ever if your team would like more help & support please do let us know.
Most teams make a lot of progress as the competition nears, as well as at the event itself, so don't worry if it seems your team still has a lot to do!

We'll send out further details about the event in the coming weeks. In the meantime, if you do have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

If your team can't make the event in April, or you are otherwise unable to continue in Student Robotics, please let us know as soon as possible.

## Checking in

We just wanted to check in on how your team is getting on with their robot? You're just over half way through the competition cycle.

It'd be great to hear what you team is currently working on, any difficulties they've faced, and whether there's anything they or you would like a hand with.

As a reminder, the penultimate Challenge submission deadline is next weekend (6pm GMT on February 21st), so make sure you've got your submissions in before then to get maximum points. These points can make all the difference when it comes to the competition weekend in April.
