Hi,

I'm pleased to confirm your place at the February Challenge Day in Horsham.

The venue has a small car park to the rear which you are welcome to use. If you do plan to use this, please let us know the registration number of the vehicle so we can add it to their parking system.

There's an outline of the day on the event page on our website. It's a great opportunity to spend a whole day working on completing challenges with live judging, quick feedback and the ability to iterate quickly.

We look forward to seeing you then.
