Hi,

Thanks for signing up for SR2026! We hope your team have embraced the challenge and are looking forward to building their robot.

Before we can ship you a kit, we need a few pieces of information:

- Our Kit Disclaimer form, which  covers the terms and conditions under which you may use the kit and outlines the limits of our responsibilities.
- A shipping invoice, to help cover the costs of shipping the kit to you.

| Item | Received? |
|------|-----------|
| Kit Disclaimer Form | {{ received_disclaimer }} |
| Shipping invoice paid | {{ invoice_paid }} |

Unfortunately, we don't have both of these back from you. Without both of them, we aren't able to ship your kit to you. If you believe the above is incorrect, please let us know.

The sooner we have all the required information, the sooner we can dispatch your kit. Our aim is to be dispatching kits once a week as information arrives.

Until your kit arrives, there's still plenty for your team to be getting started with. Not only can they be planning and researching for their robot, but they can also be completing the [simulator activities][simulator-activities], as well as the [Simulator Challenge][rules] (which is worth real points).

If you no longer wish to, or are unable to compete in this year's competition, please let us know.
