Hi,

You're in! We're happy to confirm you've got a place at Student Robotics 2026!

Thank you for taking on the role of a [team supervisor][team-supervisor] for
your team. If you have any questions about the [competition programme][programme-structure],
building a robot or anything else, please feel free to reach out to us in the
`#team-supervisors` channel on [Discord][discord] or email us at
<teams@studentrobotics.org>.

This year we're hosting [Kickstart][kickstart] at the University of Southampton,
on Saturday 8th November. We will also be live-streaming the event if you are
unable to attend in person. In that case we encourage that your team meet up to
watch the presentations, get to know each other and start working together on
the kit. If your plans for Kickstart change from what you put on the sign-up
form, please let us know so we can plan accordingly.

{% if attending_kickstart %}

## Kit Collection

As usual we will loan your team a [kit][kit] of parts to help build your robot. Since you're attending kickstart, you'll be able to collect it there. We look forward to seeing you there.

At the event, you'll need to sign a Kit Disclaimer form (PDF attached). This disclaimer covers the terms and conditions
under which you may use the kit and outlines the limits of our responsibilities. If you can read, sign it and return before the event, it will speed up issuing your kit.

{% else %}

## Kit Shipping

As usual we will loan your team a [kit][kit] of parts to help build your robot.
This year we hope to send out kits shortly before Kickstart.

In order to enable us to send out your kit you need to agree to our _kit
disclaimer_ (PDF attached). This disclaimer covers the terms and conditions
under which you may use the kit and outlines the limits of our responsibilities.
Please **sign it, scan it and email it back to us**.

As mentioned in our announcement email, to manage our rising costs, this year you will need to cover the cost of postage for your kit if you are not attending Kickstart in person. Please see the attached invoice with further information.

We will be sending your kit to the shipping address you provided when you signed
up:

    TODO_SHIPPING_ADDRESS

We will send you an email with a tracking link once your kit is on its way. Disclaimers and invoices returned after Friday 31st October may result in your kit arriving after kickstart.

{% endif %}

## Discord

To support your team throughout the year and enable you to share experiences
with other teams we have a [Discord][discord] server. This is the primary
communication method for competitor support, enabling competitors to get support
directly from our volunteer mentors at any time.

The invite link is <https://discord.com/invite/TODO_REPLACE_DISCORD_LINK_BEFORE_SENDING>.

If you don't already have a Discord account, you can register an account for
free. Accounts should be per individual and not shared with others.

Within Discord there are a number of shared channels, which everyone has access
to. Additionally there is a channel which is just for your team, which can only
be accessed by yourself, your competitors, and our Blueshirt volunteers. Your
team's channel is called `#team-TODO_REPLACE_TLA_BEFORE_SENDING`.

Upon joining the server users will need to provide a password to gain the
correct permissions. The password is used to identify which team a user is from,
so do not share to those outside your team. Please share both the invite link and
the relevant password with your competitors.

For your team, the password is: TODO_REPLACE_PASSWORD_BEFORE_SENDING

More information on this can be found in [the docs][discord].

Additionally, we like to make sure we are aware which members are volunteers,
competitors and team supervisors. If you provided your Discord username when you
signed up we will assign you the 'Team Supervisor' role once you've joined. If
you didn't, then please reply to this email with your Discord username once you
have joined the server and we will add the appropriate roles.

Whilst most of the discussions and support will be happening on Discord, if you
are unable to or do not wish to create an account with Discord you can still
[contact us][mailto-teams] for support, however the response times will be
longer. Additionally for SR2026 some elements of the competition will require
posting to Discord, so please do encourage your team to join. If you are unable
to do this, please [let us know][mailto-teams] so we can work out alternative
ways to accommodate your team.

## Looking ahead

If your team would like to get started before Kickstart, we have prepared some [pre-Kickstart activities][pre-kickstart-activities] which
introduce robotics and our simulator without needing the kit. If your team needs
any assistance with these activities, please encourage them to post in Discord.

At various points in the year we will have a number of "[Tech Days][tech-days]"
at locations around the UK. These provide an opportunity for your team to get
hands-on help from our volunteer mentors, make progress on their robot, and meet
other teams. We'll let you know once we have more details about these events.

We look forward to seeing you at Kickstart!
