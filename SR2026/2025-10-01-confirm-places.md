Hi,

You're in! We're happy to confirm you've got a place at Student Robotics 2026!

Thank you for taking on the role of a [team supervisor][team-supervisor] for
your team. If you have any questions about the [competition programme][programme-structure],
building a robot or anything else, please feel free to reach out to us in the
`#team-supervisors` channel on Discord once it's available or email us at
<teams@studentrobotics.org>.

This year we're hosting [Kickstart][kickstart] at the University of Southampton,
on Saturday 8th November. We will also be live-streaming the event if you are
unable to attend in person. In that case we encourage that your team meet up to
watch the presentations, get to know each other and start working together on
the kit. If your plans for Kickstart change from what you put on the sign-up
form, please let us know so we can plan accordingly.

## Kit Collection

As usual we will loan your team a [kit][kit] of parts to help build your robot. Since you're attending kickstart, you'll be able to collect it there. We look forward to seeing you there.

At the event, you'll need to sign a Kit Disclaimer form (PDF attached). This disclaimer covers the terms and conditions
under which you may use the kit and outlines the limits of our responsibilities. If you can read, sign it and return before the event, it will speed up issuing your kit.

## Kit Shipping

As usual we will loan your team a [kit][kit] of parts to help build your robot.
This year we hope to send out kits shortly before Kickstart.

In order to enable us to send out your kit you need to agree to our _kit
disclaimer_ (PDF attached). This disclaimer covers the terms and conditions
under which you may use the kit and outlines the limits of our responsibilities.
Please **sign it, scan it and email it back to us**.

As mentioned in our announcement email, to manage our rising costs, this year you will need to cover the cost of postage for your kit if you are not attending Kickstart in person. Please see the attached invoice with further information.

We will be sending your kit to the shipping address you provided when you signed
up:

    TODO_SHIPPING_ADDRESS

We will send you an email with a tracking link once your kit is on its way. Disclaimers and invoices returned after Friday 31st October may result in your kit arriving after kickstart.

{% endif %}

## Looking ahead

If your team would like to get started before Kickstart, the [simulator][simulator] is available to start playing around with, as well as the [API documentation][docs]. If your team needs any assistance with these, please encourage them to post in Discord once it's made available.

At various points in the year we will have a number of "[Tech Days][tech-days]"
at locations around the UK. These provide an opportunity for your team to get
hands-on help from our volunteer mentors, make progress on their robot, and meet
other teams. We'll let you know once we have more details about these events.

We look forward to seeing you at Kickstart!
