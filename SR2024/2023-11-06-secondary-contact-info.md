Hello there,

As you're hopefully aware from $TODO_PRIMARY_CONTACT_FULL_NAME,
[Student Robotics](https://studentrobotics.org) is an exciting competition for
16-19 year-olds which a team from $TODO_ORGANISATION is taking part in.

$TODO_PRIMARY_CONTACT_GIVEN_NAME gave us your details as a secondary contact at
$TODO_ORGANISATION in the unlikely case that we are unable to contact them.
Please speak to them in the first instance if you have any questions.

Our communication with your team will all be sent to
$TODO_PRIMARY_CONTACT_GIVEN_NAME, however if you would like to be copied into
our emails with your team then feel free to let us know.

-- Student Robotics Competition Team
