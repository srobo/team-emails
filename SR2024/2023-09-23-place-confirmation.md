You're in! We're happy to confirm you've got a place at Student Robotics 2024!

As the new school year starts, so does Student Robotics. The year starts with a
"[Kickstart][kickstart]" event which gives competitors and team supervisors an
introduction to this year's competition and overview of how to build and
engineer their robot.

At various points in the year we will have a number of "Tech Days" at locations
around the UK. These provide an opportunity for your team to get hands-on help
from our volunteer mentors, make progress on their robot and meet other teams.

Throughout the year your team will be able to get support for our mentors via
[Discord][discord]. In addition to shared channels where any team can ask
questions, each team will have their own private text chat channel and team
supervisors can request voice & video channels too. These offer a space for
teams to discuss their robot and get direct support from our mentors at any
time. We will send out invites to Discord separately.

This year **Kickstart is fully virtual**. On the day we will be livestreaming an
introduction to the competition, the game and the [robotics kits][kit-docs]. We
will also be providing a set of tasks which will familiarise competitors with
the kit. There will be mentors around in Discord throughout the day to support
teams working through these tasks.

We strongly encourage teams to meet up to watch the presentations, get to know
each other and start working together on the kit. We will be shipping kits out
to teams ahead of the event, so _please ensure we have the correct shipping address_.

To receive your robotics kit loan we need a few things from you:

- A _secondary contact_ for your team. This should be someone at your
  institution (e.g: head of department). They should know about the
  competition, and be able to act as a backup contact.
- You need to agree to our _kit disclaimer_ (PDF attached). This disclaimer
  covers the terms and conditions under which you may use the kit and outlines
  the limits of our responsibilities. Please sign it, scan it and email it back
  to us.
- Confirmation of your _shipping address_.

Please fill in this form to confirm your shipping address and provide details of
your secondary contact:

So that your kit arrives in time for Kickstart please ensure we have the
necessary details by 1st October.

We'll send out more information about this year's [Discord][discord] server and
[Kickstart][kickstart] event in the coming weeks. We look forward to seeing you
then!
