Hello,

We hope your team found Kickstart useful and are excited for the year ahead - we certainly are!

This year, as usual we would like to offer mentoring support through the year, and get some initial data. Mentoring support from one of our volunteers can be invaluable in terms of helping understand the kit, rules and competition; in encouraging and pushing your teams; and as enthusiastic role models.

Please fill out the form below - if you register an interest in mentoring while we can't guarantee regular support we'll do our best to match you with a volunteer as soon as we're able.

We would also like one of your students to post a short report in your team's Discord channel after they meet so we are better able to offer help. If you/your teams are not yet in Discord and you need help, please let us know.

Regards,
- The Competition Team
